This is a Read me for the instructions for Solomon AI App

There will be complete instructions on the completetion.

For now:

1. Create a way through the Forget button for the AI to Forget Chat History
2. Make a way that user gets there own chatroom for their own device ( thinking of using localStorage to save their generated chatroom id if none is found)
3. Text gui so user gets some guidance upon launching the app( maybe floating in the middle of the chatbox)
